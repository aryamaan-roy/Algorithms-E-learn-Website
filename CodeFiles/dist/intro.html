                    <br>
                    <b>PROOF : </b>We can easily create a bijection from natural numbers to binary strings just by
                    mapping the decimal form to binary form. And hence we can easily see that the binary relation is
                    formed here and hence the finite length bit strings {0,1}* is countable.

                    <p class="mb-0">Any infinite set is called uncountable if we cant establish any bijection relation

                    <b><i>Theorem : </i></b>
                    The power set of bit strings P({0,1}*) is uncountable.
                    <br>
                    <b>PROOF : </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lets define function f(x):{0,1}* -> {0,1} such that for each subset S of the set P, we will
                        define it with a binary string such that value 1 for the elements present in the set and value
                        0 for elements not present in the set.
                    <li>Now lets assume that set P is a countable set, then we can list all the binary language as
                        a sequence L1, L2, L3, L4 ..... supposedly containing every language of bit strings.

                    <li>If we list them in a table then we can easily see that we can use Cantor's diabolical
                        diagonal property to create one such binary string using the diagonal elements of the table such
                        that it does not exist in the bijective relation table. And hence we found atleast one binary
                        string
                        in set P which cannot be mapped to natural numbers using any bijective relation. And hence the
                        set
                        P, power set of the binary strings is uncountable.

                <h3> CONNECTION TO COMPUTING</h3>
                <b><i>Theorem : </i></b>
                There are computational problems that computer cannot solve.
                <br>
                <b>PROOF : </b>
                <ul>
                    <li>We simply have to show that there are more computational problems than computer programs.

                    <li>We very well know that every computer program can be represented as a binary string and hence
                        the set of
                        computer programs is countable.
                    <li>But since we know that problems are membership queries in languages hence the set of all
                        problems has
                        the same cardinality as the P({0,1}*), and since the power set is uncountable it is clear that
                        number of
                        computational problems are more than computer programs and hence there exists atleast one
                        computational problem which cannot be solved using computer program.
